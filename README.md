# CAPICO-Library
A library for Python 3 that provides a variety of helper functions for working with the Canvas API. Pagination is dealt with automatically for all relevant functions (so a returned pandas DataFrame will have **ALL** information).

This library can be installed using pip (https://pypi.org/project/CC-API-jh2/).
```
pip install CC-API-jh2
```

## To begin:
```python
from CC_API_jh2 import CAPICO
```

### Pre-notes:
#### Formatting/Details of inputs:

1. URL input (url): The URL of the Canvas instance you are running the scripts on. An example would be:

    ```python
    url = 'https://canvas.ubc.ca'
    ```
    
2. DateTime input: Canvas accepts DateTime objects of UTC-8 in ISO8601 format. The easiest way to do this is by using the datetime and pytz library. An example would be:   
    
    ```python
    #Set your local timezone (takes into consideration Daylight Savings)
    local = pytz.timezone("America/Vancouver")
    time = datetime(year, month, day, hour, minutes, 0, 0, local)
    time = start_at.astimezone(pytz.UTC)
    ```

3. IDs of Canvas objects (Course, Account, etc.): They can be easily found in the URL, and should be inputted as Strings, as mentioned in the function specifications below. For example, if your URL was as follows, https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/12345, then:

    ```python
    course_id = '12345'
    ```
